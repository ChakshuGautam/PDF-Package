HOW To implement them :


The implementation of the tools mentioned earlier for automating document creation may vary 
depending on the tool chosen. However, here are some general steps for implementing them.


Choose the right tools.
Evaluate the different tools above based on your project needs, ease of use, and compatibility with your
 preferred document format (Markdown, reStructuredText, etc.). Choose the tool that best fits your needs.

Installation and setup:
Follow the installation instructions in the documentation to install the tool of your choice. 
These tools can usually be installed using a package manager such as pip (for Python-based tools) or
npm (for JavaScript-based tools). construction:
Each tool has its own configuration mechanism for defining document structure, style, and behavior.
Read the tool's documentation on how to configure and customize it.

Content creation:
Begins creating document content using the specified markup language (Markdown, 
reStructuredText, etc.). Organize your content into appropriate sections, chapters, or 
pages to ensure a clear and logical structure.

Document creation and production:
Most documentation tools provide commands or scripts to create and 
generate documentation. These commands typically parse content files and generate suitable 
HTML, PDF, or other output formats. Run the build command to generate the documentation files.

Preview and review:
After you create your document, you can preview it locally through your web server, or open 
the generated file in your web browser and preview it. Check your documentation for proper presentation, 
format, and accuracy.

Mission:
Decide on a hosting platform

basic steps to Run Jekyll: 


To use or integrate Jekyll to automate document creation, follow these steps:


Install Jekyll:
Jekyll is based on the Ruby programming language. So make sure you have Ruby installed on your system.
To install Jekyll, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

  " Gem installs the Jekyll bundler "  #Copy code

Create a new Jekyll site: 
After installing Jekyll, navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your Jekyll site.
Create a new Jekyll site by running the following command:

   "Jekyll's new site"      #Copy code  

Configure Jekyll:
The newly created Jekyll site directory (mysite in the example above) has various configuration files,
including _config.yml. Open this file in a text editor and adjust the configuration options according to your 
requirements. You can specify your site's title, base URL, theme, plugins, and other settings in this file. 

Create content:
Jekyll uses a specific directory structure to organize its content. 
By default, markdown files in the _posts directory are used to generate blog posts.
You can create additional directories and files for other content types such as pages, collections, 
and data files.

Customize your layout:
Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language to create reusable page templates. 
You can customize the default layouts or create your own layouts in the _layouts directory. 
These layouts define the structure and design of your pages.

Assemble and provide:
To generate an HTML file from your Jekyll site, in a terminal or command prompt 
navigate to your site's directory and run the following command:

   "bundle run jekyll build " #Copy code
This command processes the site's files and produces HTML output in the _site directory.

Preview and test:
You can preview your Jekyll site locally by running the following command:

    "bundle run jekyll serve " #Copy code
This will start a local web server and allow you to open the specified URL in your browser 
to view her website. When you change your content or configuration, Jekyll will automatically 
regenerate your site so you can preview your changes in real time.

Deployment: 
Once you're happy with your Jekyll site, you can deploy it to a web hosting service or static 
site hosting platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify. Refer to your chosen hosting platform's documentation 
for specific instructions on hosting your Jekyll site.

These steps provide a basic overview of automating document creation with Jekyll. For more information on 
customizing themes, using plugins, and extending the functionality of Jekyll sites, see the Jekyll documentation.
